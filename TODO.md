# TODO: Implement Dark and Light Mode Toggle

## Overview
Apply dark and light mode to the full project by adding a toggle button in the Header near the profile section, and updating components with dark mode classes.

## Steps
- [ ] Add ThemeSwitch component to Header.jsx near the profile dropdown
- [ ] Update Header.jsx with dark mode classes (bg, text, borders)
- [ ] Update Layout.jsx with dark mode classes (bg, text)
- [ ] Update Postcard.jsx with dark mode classes
- [ ] Update Feed.jsx with dark mode classes
- [ ] Update other key components (e.g., UpcomingEvents, Birthdays, JobCard) with dark mode classes
- [ ] Test the toggle functionality by running the app
- [ ] Verify dark mode persists across page reloads (via localStorage in ThemeContext)
